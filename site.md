## To update and create new post/page
1. For content creation, use accounts associated with one of those four roles: 'Author', 'Contributor', 'Editor', 'Subscriber'. Unless absolutely necessary, **do not** use 'Admin' account for creating new content.

2. Starting on the `Staging Site`, create a backup file using [All-in-one WP Migration](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/) before you start any editing. To make sure a snapshot is always available in case of emergency.

3. After adding content, preview to check for errors, you should create a new backup file on `Staging Site`, then upload the backup file to transfer content into `Live Site`.
