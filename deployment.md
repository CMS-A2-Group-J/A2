# Deployment Workflow

- Staging site
  - For staging site, we require admin/user to use `localhost` as staging site.
- Live site
  - Our live server is at: https://baizonnlearning.click

## Project management
Tools we are using:
- [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/CMS-A2-Group-J/projects/1)
  - For porject management, we create a new iteration every week, then add and update tasks to indicate development progess.
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/82SSbSvv)
  - We are using discord for all group communication activities, including daily standup, collaboration works, and sharing resource materials.

## Version control
- GitHub
  - For all php files (theme etc.), use this [repo](https://github.com/cMS-A2-Group-J/a2) to store.
- Backup plugin & backup policy
  - Everyday, admins need to create backup at `live server` using [All-in-one WP Migration](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/), download backup file name it as `backup-YYYY-MM-DD`.
  - Retention policy: all backup files must keep for 30 days before deletion.
